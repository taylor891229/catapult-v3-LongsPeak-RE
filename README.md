## Project overview  
This project aims to document the Catapult v3 SmartNIC cards that can be found occasionally on eBay.  
These cards seem to be used in several Microsoft projects and Azure servers.  
There are at least two versions of these cards:  
- PCI Express "standard" card format, codename `'Longs Peak'`  
- Open Compute Project (OCP) Mezzanine card format, codename `'Dragontails Peak'`, for this form factor there are at least three variants  
  - Board with 10AXF40GAA  
  - Board with 10AX090N3F40E2SG  
  - Board with 10AS066N3F40I2SGES  

Each of these SmartNIC features a large Arria 10 FPGA, 4 GB of DDR4-SDRAM, 128MB of flash memory for FPGA configuration, one Mellanox NIC ASIC, one QSFP+ port for 50Gb Ethernet connectivity, three 8x PCIe Gen3 interfaces, an onboard USB programmer and several LEDs.  
As usual in these strange pieces of hardware, it's hard to find any kind of documentation.

The main goal is to recycle these boards and use them as a cheap platform for FPGA learning and development from a hobbyist point of view.

The [BOM](Documents/BOM.xlsx) spreadsheet contains a Bill of Materials for some ICs.  
The [GoldenTop](Projects/GoldenTop) project contains a simple Quartus design with a top level entity exposing all found FPGA pins.  

## TODO List  
The following tasks are pending:  
- Test/verify the untested tasks in previous point.  
- Stablish communication between the FPGA and the Mellanox NIC ASIC.  
- Incomplete or inaccurate constraints for already identified pins.  
- Find some remaining unknown/GPIO pins in FPGA.
- The OCP card variant mounting the Arria 10 SOC isn't documented in this project.   
- Find the purpose of following components.  
  - U20 (Unknown, not found datasheet for this component).  
  - U55 (I2C multiplexer). Able to identify and manipulate this component through I2C bus, but the purpose of some some IO pins is unknown.  
  - U22 (Level shifter with programmable I/O directions), unknown purpose of some pins, seems to communicate the FPGA with the Mellanox NIC ASIC and with the U55 IOs. This component interconnects several FPGA pins with Mellanox NIC ASIC and U55 pins.  
- Find the datasheet for some small components (maybe level shifters or voltage regulators?).  
- Create a complete documentation (PDF document, etc.).  
- Create a software interface to manage the devices attached to I2C bus.  

## Some notes  

#### About the contents in this repo  
There are the following folders in this repo:  
- **Documents**: Contains several subfolders with pictures, datasheets, spreadsheets, etc.  
- **Projects**: Contains the Quartus projects organized in subfolders for each category.  
Some projects have a `'Software'` subfolder containing the NIOS II EDS projects with the apps and BSP to be used in conjunction with the hardware project.

#### About the hardware components  
- The FPGA P/N `10AXF40GAA` isn't listed in the Arria 10 datasheets and seems to use a non-standard nomenclature pattern.  
![](Documents/Pictures/a10_nomenclature.jpg)  
According to [this](https://twitter.com/rombik_su/status/1341125492884332549) [@rombik_su](https://twitter.com/rombik_su) twitter thread, this device is identical to `10AX115N4F40E3SG`, also the Quartus device properties window reports the same characteristics.  
However, there are [some pictures](https://www.nextplatform.com/2020/02/03/vertical-integration-is-eating-the-datacenter-part-two/) for the OCP card mounting this P/N `10AX090N3F40E2SG`.  
![](Documents/Pictures/ocp_variant.png)  
Also, in this picture, some components such as Y4 oscillator is missing, this clock is supposed that drives the DDR4 interface on the top side, maybe this is another variant of these cards.  
Anyways, Quartus is able to generate the bitstreams for the `10AXF40GAA` and this strange Arria 10 device seems to accept all of them (`10AXF40GAA`, `10AX115N4F40E3SG` or `10AX090N3F40E2SG`)
- It seems that the PCIe version have a better Mellanox NIC ASIC hardware: ConnectX 3Pro vs ConnectX 4Lx.  
ConnectX 3Pro is 40GbE capable and ConnectX 4Lx is 50GbE.
- Although the amount of RAM is 5GB only 4.5GB are usable. One of the chips of each channel has only 8 bits wired to the FPGA.  
- Unable to find any documentation for the PCIe side connector J8 in OCP card, only the SAMTEC bottom connector appears in the OCP documents, this one seems to be a proprietary connection. It carries 16 pairs of lanes with differential signals for PCIe (8Rx + 8Tx), one PCIe reset signal (PERST_N) and one cable detection pin.
- FPGA oscillator Y6 is 644.53125 MHz for PCIe card and 156.250 MHz for OCP card. This oscillator is supposed that clocks the FPGA communication with the Mellanox NIC ASIC. This makes sense that ConnectX 3Pro has a lower speed for interconnect with FPGA (maybe 40GbE or 10GbE?).
- The dedicated JTAG header (J5) can't be used with some cheap USB Blaster clones.

#### About the use of Quartus programmer and tools with the onboard USB programmer  
When connected to a computer via USB, these boards are recognized as standard FTDI COM ports.  
Even though some tools such TopJTAG Probe or OpenOCD allows to use the FTDI ports as JTAG programmers, the Quartus tools doesn't recognize these devices as valid programming hardware.  
The following options are reliable to make Quartus tools work:  
 - The [jtag-mpsse-blaster](https://github.com/tow3rs/jtag-mpsse-blaster) project allows to use these boards with Quartus tools in Windows and Linux systems.  
 - Jan Marjanoviƒç's project https://github.com/j-marjanovic/jtag-quartus-ft232h, allows using the FT232H as a JTAG interface for use with Quartus tools in Linux environments.  
 - Applying a small patch to the [Arrow USB Programmer](https://shop.trenz-electronic.de/Download/?path=Trenz_Electronic/Software/Drivers/Arrow_USB_Programmer) lib/dll allows any FTDI chip that implements the MPSSE protocol such as FT2232D, FT2232H, FT4232H or FT232H to be used as USB Blaster by Quartus tools in Windows or Linux environments.  

Anyways, a standard Altera USB Blaster connected on the J5 Header works like a charm. Note that some cheap USB Blaster clones doesn't work in these boards.  

#### Configuring the retimer (DS250DF8) for 40/50Gbps Ethernet connectivity  
According to the datasheet, on power up, the retimer is configured by default to operate at a rate of 25 Gbps per channel.    
The Arria 10 GX transceivers can operate at a maximum rate of 17.4 or 12.5 Gbps depending on speed grade.  
If the retimer can't get CDR lock, the output is muted and connection can't be done.  
To establish a 40/50 Gbps link, the retimer must be programmed with a rate of 10.3125 Gbps or 12.5 Gbps for each lane.
The DS250DF810 programming guide isn't publicly available but there are [some TI forum threads](https://e2e.ti.com/support/interface-group/interface/f/interface-forum/986243/ds250df810-using-25g-retimer-with-1g-ethernet) talking about quick programming the bitrate for this device.  
The retimer is present at address 0x22 and can be programmed via I2C using a soft NIOS processor instantiated in the FPGA or using an external I2C device connected to the J10 header.  

![](Documents/Pictures/retimer.png)  

The following two steps allows to configure the eight retimer channels to operate at the desired rate.  
1. Enable access to channel registers and configure it to broadcast changes to all channels (this allows to set the bitrate for the eight retimer lanes in a single instruction)  
`Writing a value 0x3 in the register 0xFF`

2. Set the rate  
`Writing one of the following values in the register 0x2F with mask 0xF0`  

| Single lane rate | QSFP port aggregated rate | Value for reg 0x2F | Write mask |
|--------------|--------------|------|------|
| 10.3125 Gbps | 41.25 Gbps   | 0x00 | 0xF0 |
| 10.9375 Gbps | 43.7428 Gbps | 0x10 | 0xF0 |
| 12.5 Gbps    | 50.0 Gbps    | 0x20 | 0xF0 |  

It's possible to configure the retimer to work in non-retimed mode, this allow to bypass CDR lock and output raw data for use with custom bitrates.  
`Writing the value 0x0 in the register 0x1E with mask 0xE0 enables the bypass mode, the value 0xE0 disables the bypass mode`

Fine tunning the retimer requires the study of the device datasheet and the programming guide, but the previous steps allows to test the QSFP port connectivity for 40/50Gbps Ethernet or other network protocols.

The project [SuperliteII_V4_QSFP](Projects/Network/SuperliteII_V4_QSFP) contains a port of one of the [IntelFPGA Wiki examples](https://community.intel.com/t5/FPGA-Wiki/High-Speed-Transceiver-Demo-Designs-Arria-10-Series/ta-p/735131) for High Speed Transceiver Demo Designs - Arria 10 Series.  
This project uses a custom protocol called `Superlite II` to test the connectivity in the QSFP port, it only works when two SmartNICs running this project are connected with a QSFP cable. This protocol is incompatible with Ethernet, IB or other network protocols.  
This project is basically a copy/paste version of the original one adapted to work in these Catapult V3 SmartNICs, only the following new features where added.  
 - FPGA pin assignments and some other minor changes to adapt it for Catapult V3 boards.  
 - New option to change the bitrate between 10.3125, 10.9375 or 12.5 Gbps.  
 - New option to show QSFP cable information.  
 - Removed some unused options to simplify the code.
 - Status information mapped to LEDs.

#### Connectivity between the FPGA and the Mellanox NIC  
Although the NIC has PCIe connectivity and it's detected as a valid network adapter, it's impossible to establish a link with the FPGA.  
At this point several posible things can happen.  
 - Some IO pins from the NIC remains unidentified and they are used to bring up the chip.  
 - Hardware fail in Mellanox NIC side, FPGA side or both.
